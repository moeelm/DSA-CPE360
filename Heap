Heap Data Strucutre:
1. Binary Tree
2. Balance = Nodes from 0 to D(depth) -2 have two children
3. Left Justified = all leaf nodes are far left as possible
4. "Heap Property" = the value of the parent must be greater than both children					


First create the tree structure by going one level at a time and then left to right, then delete the root for the sorting to continue

Don't use Heap sort if memory is an issue
